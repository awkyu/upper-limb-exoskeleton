# upper-limb-exoskeleton
BME 590 Rehabilitation Robotics Project

This project is the start to the design of a three degree-of-freedom upper limb exoskeleton used for spiking a ball.  While it is quite limited and additional controls need to be implemented, this paper describes the preliminary control strategy for basic torque control.
